63 Days after Exile
	Day 63,


17 days of being stuck down here, can you believe that?
17 days since cave in, and we STILL haven't found a way out of this mess.


At this rate we'll never return with enough resources to pay off our debt.
Needless to say, the mining expedition has gone horribly thus far.


	Day 64,


Our rations have run lower than the crew's morale,
Lil' Don has mysteriously vanished,
and Sera keeps complaining that she has "Two shadows".


I don't know what to think of all this.


	Day 65,


Jacob keeps claiming he saw a man in the darkness, but refuses to describe him.


Poor, senile old man. He shouldn't have come with us in the first place.
Heck, we shouldn't have come here at all.


We should have listened to the other villagers when they said no one mined in this cave system for a reason.
Alas, it's too late now.


	Day 66,


When I woke up this morning, I reached for my torch as I always do. This time, though, it was handed to me.
When I turned to see who had gave me the torch, I saw no one.


I can't take much more of this.


	Day 72,


They're all gone. All of them.


Starvation will claim me soon, if nothing else does.


Abigail, if you're reading this; tell the council that Antonio wasn't a madman; he was right.




They DO exist.


	Day 73,


He's watching me. I keep seeing him in my peripheral vision, just out of sight.
I know he's there at all times,
watching me with his lifeless eyes.




I don't want to die.




	Day 74,
